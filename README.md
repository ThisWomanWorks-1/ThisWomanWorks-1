- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThisWomanWorks-1
- 👀 I’m interested in A, edtech, biotech, and more. I like keeping my ears and eyes open to what's needed and what's new. The competitive edge a company can gain by upskilling its employees and knowledge-sharing among employees, **that** excites me!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on AI tool-related skills, additional markdown skills, graphic design skills, and other skills.
- 🔍 I enjoy research and "finding things." My very first job was as a library page. That experience provided public engagement skills, systems experience, organizatonal skills, patience and more. 
- 💞️ I welcome connections related to instructional design, content strategy, and graphic design techniques for effective learning including use of Storyline, H5P, and other assessment tools and more. 
- 🌎 I work to do my part to make the world a little better place through everyday work and kindnesses ... and you learn a lot through really listening to others. I also greatly admire the one-word “THINK” slogan developed by Thomas Watson Sr.
